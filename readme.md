# Softub

This project is based on this greate work from Monroe Williams
https://github.com/monroewilliams/softub

Most importantly, I added schedulers. This allows you to configure up to 5 different switch-on times.

### Default IP address
When in AP mode, the default IP address is 192.168.4.1

### OTA
OTA is enabled, use default IP address or if connected to a AP the correct address.
Port is the default port.

### Configuration options
After the first boot, there are some values needs to be set up.
These items are maked with __*__ (star) in the list below.

You can set up the following values in the configuration page:

-  __Thing name__ - Please change the name of the device to
a name you think describes it the most. It is advised to
incorporate a location here in case you are planning to
set up multiple devices in the same area. You should only use
english letters, and the "_" underscore character. Thus, must not
use Space, dots, etc. E.g. `lamp_livingroom` __*__
- __AP password__ - This password is used, when you want to
access the device later on. You must provide a password with at least 8,
at most 32 characters.
You are free to use any characters, further more you are
encouraged to pick a password at least 12 characters long containing
at least 3 character classes. __*__
- __WiFi SSID__ - The name of the WiFi network you want the device
to connect to. __*__
- __WiFi password__ - The password of the network above. Note, that
unsecured passwords are not supported in your protection. __*__

## Blinking codes
Prevoius chapters were mentioned blinking patterns, now here is a
table summarize the menaning of the blink codes.

- __Rapid blinking__ (mostly on, interrupted by short off periods) -
Entered Access Point mode. This means the device create an own WiFi
network around it. You can connect to the device with your smartphone
(or WiFi capable computer).
- __Alternating on/off blinking__ - Trying to connect the configured
WiFi network.
- __Mostly off with occasional short flash__ - The device is online.

## Reset
When CONFIG_PIN is pulled to ground on startup, the Thing will use the initial
password to buld an AP. (E.g. in case of lost password)

Reset pin is D3 / IO17
